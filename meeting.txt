Task to do: Correct the data collection for average queue length on arrival, play around with the code base.

Meeting points discussed:
In the future, we plan to modify the architecture from the current FIFO (First In, First Out) system to a priority queue or another dispatching algorithm.

For this task, each agent will have a predefined processing time, which can be derived from a distribution. Please consider how we can adjust the `agent.py` file to incorporate this representation for the agents.

Additionally, we need to explore how to represent robots and conveyors within this system. If the existing system cannot accommodate these representations, we may need to restructure the code in the future.

Lastly, letâ€™s think about visualizations for the queuing station.
