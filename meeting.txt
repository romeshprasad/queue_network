Task to do: Correct the data collection for average queue length on arrival, play around the code base.

Meeting points discussed:
In future we would like to modify the architecture from present FIFO to priority queue or other dispatching algorithm.
For such work, each agent would have a predefined processing time and that can come from a distribution.
So think on how we can modify the agent.py file to add such representation to the agent.
Additionally, we would like to think of representing robots and conveyors within this system? So, think on how can we represent them in the present system
If the present system cannot handle the representation then in future we would have to redo the structure of the code.
Think about visualization for the queuing station.
