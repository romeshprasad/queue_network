# Series Network with Multiple Servers per Queue
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
#   Three queues in series where each queue has multiple parallel servers.
#   Demonstrates M/M/c queues in a network context.
#
# Theoretical Comparison:
#   Use: series(arrival_rate=3.0, service_rate=[1.5,1.5,2.0],
#              num_servers=[2,3,2])
#   Expected: All utilizations < 1 for stability
#             ρ0=1.0, ρ1=0.667, ρ2=0.75
#
# Use Case:
#   Manufacturing line with workstations of varying capacity
