# ==============================================================================
# Finite Capacity Network with Rejection
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
#   Three queues in series with limited buffer space at each stage.
#   Customers are rejected (lost) when a queue is full.
#   This is a loss system, NOT a blocking system.
#
# Theoretical Note:
#   Use: Jacksonnetworkfinitecapacity(...) [APPROXIMATE ONLY]
#   Theory does NOT account for rejection cascade effects properly.
#   Simulation is the best approach for this scenario.
#
# Features:
#   - Increasing capacity downstream (5 → 10 → 15)
#   - Rejections expected at all stages
#   - Loss probability tracking
