# ==============================================================================
# Multi-Class Factory: Express, Standard, and Bulk Orders
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
#   Manufacturing facility handling three types of orders:
#   - Express (30%): Fast service, skip middle inspection (Q1)
#   - Standard (50%): Normal processing through all stations
#   - Bulk (20%): Slower service, 20% rework rate at Q1
#
# Real-World Analogy:
#   Automotive parts manufacturer with priority orders, standard production,
#   and large batch orders that may require rework.
#
# Network Flow:
#   Q0: Receiving/Prep → Q1: Inspection → Q2: Packaging/Shipping
