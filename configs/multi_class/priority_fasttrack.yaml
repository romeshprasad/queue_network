# ==============================================================================
# Priority Fast-Track System: VIP vs Regular Customers
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
#   Two-tier service system where VIP customers skip intermediate processing.
#   Common in airports, theme parks, and customer service centers.
#
# Real-World Analogy:
#   Airport security with TSA PreCheck:
#   - VIP (30%): PreCheck lane, skip detailed screening
#   - Regular (70%): Standard security process through all checkpoints
#
# Network Flow:
#   Q0: Initial check → Q1: Detailed screening → Q2: Final clearance
