# ==============================================================================
# Hospital Emergency Department: Multi-Level Triage System
# ==============================================================================
# Description:
#   Emergency department with three patient acuity levels:
#   - Emergency (15%): Life-threatening, immediate care, fast service
#   - Urgent (35%): Serious but stable, moderate priority
#   - Routine (50%): Minor issues, standard flow
#
# Real-World Analogy:
#   Emergency room with ESI (Emergency Severity Index) triage system
#
# Network Flow:
#   Q0: Triage → Q1: Treatment → Q2: Discharge/Observation
